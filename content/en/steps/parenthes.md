For the parentheses, single quotations and double quotations are available. Following steps are the same in meaning:

```
The page should contain "Login"
The page should contain 'Login'
```

### Escape Parentheses

The steps have no escape sequences to escape the parentheses. Instead, you may quote the parameter with the different type of quotations.

```
The page should contain 'Are you sure to delete the "12345" order data?'
```
